                <p><strong>Institution:</strong> National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan</p>

                <p><strong>Educational Background:</strong> During my MS, I focused on solving real-world problems using advanced computational techniques.

                <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>An Efficient Approach Towards Predicting Residential Energy Consumption Via Encoder-Decoder CNN-LSTM</em></p>
                <p><strong>Thesis Abstract:</strong> The thesis addresses the growing demand for electricity and the challenges of accurately predicting residential energy consumption. The current prediction models fail to capture the dynamic nature of energy usage due to external factors like climate and internal factors such as resident behavior. To improve prediction accuracy, we proposed a novel encoder-decoder architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The CNN component functions as an encoder, extracting relevant features through convolutional and pooling layers. These features are then passed on to the LSTM decoder, which predicts energy consumption over time. The proposed model was evaluated using multiple error metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), all of which indicated superior prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. This approach offers a more robust and reliable model for forecasting energy demand, which is crucial for better power management and grid coordination.</p>

                <h3>Thesis:</h3>
                <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Pattern Formation of Swarm Robots</em></p>
                <p><strong>Thesis Abstract:</strong> Swarm robotics is a new technique in which multiple robots work together to accomplish large tasks that cannot be done by a single robot or even multiple robots individually. The technique of swarm robotics differs from traditional multi-robot systems due to the behaviors and coordination strategies involved. Swarm behavior was replicated by a group of robots designed and fabricated to demonstrate multiple tasks. One such task was chain formation, where robots autonomously position themselves to create a chain pattern between two points, demonstrating collaborative work among robots in achieving complex patterns.</p>
