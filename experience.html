            <p>
                At AiSighit.ai, my core responsibilities revolve around leveraging data science to drive business value within the FMCG sector.  
                I forecast sales and quantities using advanced machine learning and deep learning models, generating actionable insights that inform strategic decision-making.  
                This involves creating and training AI models, conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python, and automating key processes through 
                efficient scripting.  I have a proven track record of developing and implementing high-performance data pipelines on Linux platforms, optimizing data 
                processing workflows, and ensuring scalability.  A significant achievement has been leading the successful integration of our AI models into a 
                SaaS product via Dockerization, resulting in improved operational efficiency and enhanced product capabilities.  I also manage tasks using JIRA 
                and utilize Git/AWS CodeCommit for version control.

                At Sense Digital, I contributed to the development and deployment of AI-driven solutions, focusing on extracting actionable insights from diverse data sources.  
                My responsibilities included gathering and interpreting data, performing preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare data for modeling, and 
                building AI models using a range of machine learning algorithms and deep learning neural networks.  I successfully implemented ensemble learning techniques, 
                integrating multiple models (including Linear Regression, FbProphet, ARIMA, Random Forest, LSTM, XGBOOST, CNN-LSTM, and various Encoder-Decoder CNN/Conv-LSTM 
                architectures) to enhance predictive accuracy and drive robust business intelligence.  Furthermore, I worked on the Dockerization of SaaS-based products on edge 
                computing devices and developed data pipelines on Linux-based platforms.  I utilized JIRA for task management and Git/AWS CodeCommit for version control.

                quantities using a variety of models such as Fbprophet, ARIMA, Random Forest, LSTM, and XGBOOST.  I also performed granular forecasting at both the 
                customer and employee levels.  Additionally, I conducted RFM analysis to quantitatively rank and segment customers based on recency, frequency, and 
                monetary value, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

        <h2>Computer Science Lecturer | Eclat College for Girls</h2>
            <p><strong>Nov 2018 – May 2019</strong></p>
        <p>
            As a Computer Science Lecturer at Eclat College for Girls, I played a key role in shaping the next generation of computer scientists. My responsibilities 
            encompassed a range of activities, from curriculum preparation and resource management to student mentorship and assessment.  This included meticulously 
            setting up laboratory resources, designing and planning practical experiments to reinforce theoretical concepts, and assigning project work that challenged 
            students to apply their knowledge creatively.  A crucial aspect of my role was ensuring the software used in the labs remained current and functional, requiring 
            regular updates and troubleshooting.  I also dedicated time to evaluating student progress through grading tests and assignments, providing constructive feedback 
            to facilitate their learning.  Furthermore, I served as a primary point of contact for students, patiently addressing their questions, clarifying complex topics, 
            and fostering a deeper understanding of computer science principles.  This involved creating a supportive and encouraging learning environment where students felt
             comfortable seeking assistance and exploring their interests in the field.
