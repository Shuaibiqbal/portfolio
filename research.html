            <h2>Forecasting Stock Market Using Machine Learning Approach Encoder-Decoder ConvLSTM</h2>
            <p>
                The stock market prediction is a hot topic these days, and predicting the price of a stock is both difficult and important due to the numerous variables at play. There were numerous Machine Learning models submitted for Stock Market Prediction, but Hybrid Models were successful in making accurate predictions. The goal of this study is to create a hybrid Deep Learning model (Encoder-Decoder ConvLSTM) to anticipate stock market prices. We employed historical stock price data S and P500 (Daily Prices) from Yahoo’s financial website and six months dataset of State Bank of Pakistan (Hourly values). Different prediction models have been tested for the S and P500 dataset which is publicly available and after finding out that the proposed model performed well it has been applied to the SBP dataset as well. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been calculated based on the following performance metrics, root means square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). When compared to other comparable studies, the experimental findings indicate that the proposed model has the best performance metrics values. As a result, we can infer that our model is appropriate for accurate stock market time series prediction.

            <h2>Time-Series Prediction of Cryptocurrency Market using Machine Learning Techniques</h2>
            <p>
                In the market of cryptocurrency, Bitcoins are the first currency which has gained significant importance. 
                To predict the market price and stability of Bitcoin in the crypto-market, a machine learning-based time-series 
                analysis has been applied. Time-series analysis can predict the future ups and downs in the price of Bitcoin. 
                For this purpose, we have used ARIMA, FBProphet, and XGBoost for time series analysis as machine learning techniques. 
                The parameters on the basis of which we have evaluated these models are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R². 
                After conducting experiments on these three techniques, ARIMA was considered the best model for forecasting Bitcoin prices in the crypto-market with RMSE score of 322.4 and MAE score of 227.3. 
                This research can be helpful for investors in the crypto-market.

            <h2>Multilevel Feedback Queue: Efficient Scheduling and Implementation by Using Dynamic Quantum</h2>
            <p>
                A multitasking operating system allows many programs to run at the same time. Efficient CPU scheduling is necessary to handle these services. CPU scheduling algorithms come in various forms, each with advantages and disadvantages. In this project, we implemented a Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) algorithm with a static time quantum for the first queue and a dynamic time quantum for the second queue. The Round Robin (RR) algorithm was used in the first queue for processes with short burst times. Processes with longer burst times were moved to the second queue, where we calculated the average burst time of all remaining processes and set that as the quantum for the second queue, applying the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. This technique helped prevent starvation by ensuring that processes with long burst times still received CPU time, with 70% of processes in the second queue successfully getting CPU time. The approach helped maintain fairness and efficiency in multitasking environments.

            <h2>Optimizing Sales Forecasting with Time-Series Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory, improve cash flow, and better plan for growth.
                In this project, we applied time-series analysis to predict sales for a retail business based on historical sales data.
                Various time-series forecasting models, including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet, were utilized to
                analyze past sales trends and make accurate predictions for future sales. The goal was to provide businesses with 
                reliable forecasting techniques to optimize stock levels, minimize costs, and improve operational efficiency.
                After evaluating multiple models using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean 
                Squared Error (RMSE), the ARIMA model was found to yield the most accurate and reliable results for sales prediction.
                This approach provides valuable insights to businesses, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and adapt to future trends.

    <h2>Exploring Sentiment Analysis in Customer Feedback</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding customer sentiment is essential for businesses aiming to enhance customer experience, improve products,
        and increase customer loyalty. In this project, sentiment analysis was applied to customer feedback to gain valuable
        insights into customer satisfaction. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we analyzed customer
        reviews, social media comments, and survey responses to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. 
        The goal was to enable businesses to automatically assess customer satisfaction and respond more effectively to their 
        needs. Various machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models,
        were evaluated for their ability to accurately predict sentiment. After comparing the results using performance 
        metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, the deep learning-based models outperformed the traditional 
        machine learning models, showcasing their effectiveness in extracting nuanced sentiments from complex, unstructured data.
